#My Learning
The intention of this repo is for me to play with code and learn new stuff.
Using Spring boot as a base line.


##Domain
A Knight as a Sword. A Blacksmith has Tools. A Blacksmith repairs Swords.   

##Package structure:
Base on https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/#anatomy-modules

Interesting structure especial since "repository" and "resource" represent the same layer (from what I've seen)
